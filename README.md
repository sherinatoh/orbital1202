Who will benefit from our project?
NUS students and staff as well as other people who visit the NUS canteens will benefit from our project.

What are the problems our project is solving and why is it important?
The canteens are too crowded during peak hours and the consumers often end up wasting too much time queueing for food. Also students are unsure of where to go for lunch when they have limited time. Our project aims to solve the above problems through an app. This not only allows the consumers to save time, but also offers more food choices to them.

How does our project solve the problems?
Our project will solve the problems through the implementation of 3 main features:
1: Crowd management features - We are intending to use GPS or the camera system (if allowed) in the schools to let students determine if the canteens are crowded, thus allowing them to decide which canteen they should go.
2: Suggestion of nearby eating places - Depending on the amount of time the student has, the app can suggest places for the student to have their meals inside or outside of school (nearby shopping malls)
3: Queue System - Adding a queue system for the canteens to queuing time. We are also considering an online payment system for students to pay for their food in NUS canteens but we are not sure if that is feasible. 

Our targeted level of achievement
We are aiming for a minimum level of Gemini. However, if possible, we would like to strive for Apollo 11.

User Stories
As a user, I want to search for canteens that are not crowded when I have limited time between lessons for meals. To do this, the system should allow me to check the state of each canteen available in NUS through cameras or crowd numbers.
As a user, I also want to find nearby places to have a meal when I do not wish to have my meal in school. To do this, the system should provide me with details of other eateries outside school based on the amount of time I have available for a meal.
As a user, I want to be able to collect my food directly once it is ready without having to waste time queueing up. To do this, this system should provide me with a number, letting me know when my food is ready to be collected.

Our proposed timeline
For the next sprint, we are intending to implement features 1 and 2. For feature 3 and other improvements, we will do it in sprint 3. Below is our more in-depth timeline for the following 2 months.
